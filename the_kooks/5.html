<h4>The Kooks "Gap" </h4>

So put a spanner in the works<br/>
"You're mine,"<br/>
It's easier to work,<br/>
But I don't mind,<br/>
You're better in defeat so,<br/>
Just don't try<br/>
To take away all the things<br/>
I'll do in my life.<br/>
<br/>
I have to break down all<br/>
the corners of the world.<br/>
Don't heed this praise on me,<br/>
I know I don't deserve it.<br/>
But what's so this I see?<br/>
Yeah you're leaving right beside me,<br/>
And I miss you, and I need you.<br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
But don't go, take my love,<br/>
I won't let you, I'm saying please don't go.<br/>
Don't go, take my love,<br/>
I won't let you, I'm saying please don't go.<br/>
<br/>
Well leave your lover now,<br/>
it's your turn.<br/>
And see your mother now,<br/>
I hope she's okay.<br/>
You're better in defeat so,<br/>
let's not try<br/>
To take away all the things I'll do in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
I have to break down all the corners of the world.<br/>
Don't heed this praise on me,<br/>
I know I don't deserve it.<br/>
But what's so this I see?<br/>
Yeah you're leaving right beside me,<br/>
And I miss you, and I need you.<br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
But don't go, take my love,<br/>
I won't let you, I'm saying please don't go.<br/>
Don't go, take my love,<br/>
I won't let you, I'm saying please don't go.<br/>
<br/>
All of my life,<br/>
trying to understand.<br/>
All of my life,<br/>
trying to hold a hand.<br/>
<br/>
I have to break down all,<br/>
the corners of this world.<br/>
Don't heed this praise on me,<br/>
I know I don't deserve it.<br/>
But what's so this I see?<br/>
Yeah you're leaving right beside me,<br/>
And I miss you, and I love you.<br/>
That's true<br/>
