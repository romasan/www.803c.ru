<h4>The Kooks "Jackie Big Tits" </h4>

I'd like to say, that I was on your mind<br/>
So I phone you at ten past three, in the afternoon<br/>
It's evening for you, and another bare hotel room<br/>
So hard to believe, that you're dreaming of me too<br/>
But it's true<br/>
<br/>
You only go around, round, round<br/>
You only go around, round, round<br/>
You only go around, round, round<br/>
You only go around, round, round<br/>
<br/>
And Amsterdam, I never knew you so well<br/>
The stadium rings with laughter, at every turn<br/>
At flying piano's of all things, to set your scene<br/>
I'm such a nice man to you, but so obscene<br/>
And it's true girl<br/><br/>

You only go around, round, round<br/>
You only go around, round, round<br/>
You only go around, round, round<br/>
You only go around, round, round<br/>
<br/>
Jackie big tits, is hiding in the corner<br/>
Respect is the word she shouts, as I implore her<br/>
Speaks her mind not me, 'cos I was only speaking freely<br/>
Interupt me once more, I'll take you to the cleaners<br/>
<br/>
You can't push me around, round, round<br/>
You can't push me around, round, round<br/>
You only go around, round, round<br/>
You only go around, round, round<br/>
