<h4>The Kooks "Stormy Weather" </h4>
You ?? a stormy weather <br/>
from my window<br/>
You ain't, yeah, you ain't so clearly<br/>
You got it all made up<br/>
<br/>
But it feels like love, love, love<br/>
Oh yes, it feels like touch, touch, touch<br/>
<br/>
I see surround pass the time<br/>
I try to get it out of my mind<br/>
And I live in a world oh so small<br/>
That I can get around a (soup)<br/>
<br/>
And it feels like love, love, love<br/>
Oh yes, it feels like touch, touch, touch<br/>
<br/>
What did I say?<br/>
What did I say?<br/>
What did I say?<br/>
Oh, I didn't mean it<br/>
<br/>
What did I do<br/>
Or take of you?<br/>
Oh, I didn't mean it<br/>
Oh, oh, I didn't mean it!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying it's all made up<br/>
It's people there, to come your head (?)<br/>
And I ?? another song<br/>
Won't kill that, so beautiful<br/>
<br/>
So it feels like love, love, love<br/>
Oh yes, it feels like touch, touch, touch<br/>
<br/>
What did I say?<br/>
What did I say?<br/>
What did I say?<br/>
Oh, I didn't mean it<br/>
<br/>
What did I do<br/>
Or take of you?<br/>
What did I do?<br/>
Oh, I didn't mean it<br/>
Oh, oh, I didn't mean it!<br/>
<br/>
And it feels like love, love, love,<br/>
Yes, it feels like touch, touch, touch... [x4]<br/>
