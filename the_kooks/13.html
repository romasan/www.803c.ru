<h4>The Kooks "All Over Town" </h4>
Dear sir, did I see you fleeting?<br/>
I can't feel heart but not for it beating<br/>
You tried to put a frown on me, fell me down<br/>
You're spreading bad things about me, all over town<br/>
But I'll show no frown<br/>
<br/>
Because all over town, yes all over town<br/>
There are people who would, undermine you if they could<br/>
Don't let them in<br/>
<br/>
What do you see when you see me, sir?<br/>
The very same thing that makes you bitter<br/>
So you'll say all these outrageous things, that's what you do<br/>
Yes, but you're no poet man<br/>
You just want everyone looking at you<br/>
So I'll show no frown<br/>
<br/>
Because all over town, yes all over this town<br/>
There are people who would undermine you if they could<br/>
Don't let them in<br/>
<br/>
Oh, all over town, yes all over this town<br/>
There are people who would undermine me if they could<br/>
Won't let them in<br/>
