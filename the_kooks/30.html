<h4>The Kooks "I Want You Back" </h4>

Take me back to the place where I<br/>
Loved that girl for all time<br/>
Why must life just take away<br/>
Every good thing one at a time<br/>
<br/>
I want it back<br/>
Well yes I want it back<br/>
Yes I want you back<br/>
Please give it me back<br/>
Cause I want your love<br/>
<br/>
How can I not even cry?<br/>
For such a big thing in my life<br/>
The pain it takes the part of me<br/>
Turn around and say goodbye<br/>
<br/>
I want it back<br/>
Well yes I want it back<br/>
Yes I want you back<br/>
Please give it me back<br/>
Cause I want you<br/>
<br/>
How did you do it females?<br/>
It's always you do it angels<br/>
You always keep me on the run<br/>
So how did you do it angels?<br/>
Always you do it females<br/>
You always keep me on the run<br/>
<br/>
I want it back<br/>
Well yes I want it back<br/>
Yes I want you back<br/>
Please give it me back<br/>
Cause I want your love<br/>
