<h4>The Kooks "Tick Of Time" </h4>
Oh honey please, don't shed no tears<br/>
As long as im here.....<br/>
<br/>
Its far too early in the morning to be trying to call you<br/>
And far too early in the daytime to be thinking about that<br/>
<br/>
But I, (but I), but I, (but I), but I am<br/>
<br/>
What did i do in a past life, oh to deserve this<br/>
Yeah the way I make myself<br/>
He's far too innocent to be a part of such a cruel world<br/>
And it is, and it is and it is<br/>
<br/>
And so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride.<br/>
Hoping I can write her a rhyme, that might stop the tick of time<br/>
Get off this situation and feel fine,<br/>
Get off this situation and feel fine.<br/>
<br/>
What did i do to deserve her love,<br/>
I have to ask myself.<br/>
When i am such a bad man but only to her (only to her, only, only to her)<br/>
<br/>
Oh and so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride.<br/>
Oh and so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride.<br/>
Wishing, hoping I can write her a rhyme, that might stop the tick of time<br/>
Get off this situation and feel fine,<br/>
Get off this situation and feel fine<br/>
