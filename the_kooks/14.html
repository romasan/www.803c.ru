<h4>The Kooks "Watching The Ships Roll In" </h4>

Watching the ships roll in<br/>
hoping that I will still be his friend<br/>
in the morning<br/>
watching those ships roll by<br/>
wishing that I could move this earth<br/>
if I could<br/>
for you I would do<br/>
<br/>
I've got nothing to say<br/>
I've got nothing to lay at your feet<br/>
I just keep hoping<br/>
hope that you will be the man that I couldn't be<br/>
<br/>
Still watching the oceans move<br/>
if only I could show you my soul<br/>
and places I've been<br/>
<br/>
watching the ocean come<br/>
and little girls playing in the sand as I walk<br/>
longing to listen to you talk<br/>
<br/>
But I've got nothing to say<br/>
I've got nothing to lay at your feet<br/>
I just keep hoping<br/>
hope that you will be the man that I couldn't be<br/>
<br/>
I've got nothing to say<br/>
I've got nothing to lay at your feet<br/>
I just keep hoping<br/>
hope that you will be the man that I couldn't be<br/>
