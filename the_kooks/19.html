<h4>The Kooks "See The Sun" </H4>

Oh you can have it all and wrap it in the world<br/>
You can have Everything<br/>
You can have love and lots of other things<br/>
To make you think<br/>
But when it all comes down to you girl<br/>
Yeah no matter what you do<br/>
Take a look at yourself and realise<br/>
Ive been good to you<br/>
Ive been good to you<br/>
<br/>
Oh no! I didn't mean to say what I did say<br/>
All about lovers and how they should lay<br/>
That was never for me to say and say<br/>
Dont you see now how I pay<br/>
<br/>
I see the sun rising<br/>
And all you see is it fall fall fall<br/>
<br/>
So come on up<br/>
Wasn't it you who said life was like a plastic cup<br/>
To be used and then disposed of<br/>
Yeah but thats no way to live a life like yours<br/>
Don't you see now how i pay<br/>
<br/>
I see the sun rising<br/>
And all you see is it fall fall fall<br/>
<br/>
For all the times i never never turned away<br/>
And now she is there on someone else's arm<br/>
<br/>
For all the times i never never turned away<br/>
And now she is there on someone else's arm<br/>
<br/>
For all the times i never never turned away<br/>
And now she is there on someone else's arm<br/>
<br/>
For all the times i never never turned away<br/>
And now she is there on someone else's arm<br/>
