<h4>The Kooks "If Only" </h4>

Hold your head, hold your tongue, only say what you have to as a child yes i dreamed of holding<br/>
her in the silverscree, she loved her man and<br/>
loved him twice, i wish i'd been that passenger,<br/>
having fun fly my kite the devil inside wont<br/>
control my life<br/>
if only if only he wasen't so lonely<br/>
he'd have someone to play with instead of<br/>
bombing our neighbours<br/>
so here i go to see<br/>
the world with my eyes and with my soul, too<br/>
much love and so little hate the devil inside wont<br/>
control my fate, if only in only he wasen't so lonely<br/>
he'd have someone to play qith instead of<br/>
bombing our neighbours<br/>
hold your head and<br/>
run my time, the what of life no man can rhyme.<br/>
so here we are and here we bleed to be a<br/>
victim there's no need, having fun in ever fight<br/>
the devil inside controls my fate<br/>
if only<br/>
if only he wasen't so lonely he'd have someone to<br/>
play with instead of bombing our neighbour<br/>
