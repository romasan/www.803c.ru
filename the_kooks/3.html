<h4>The Kooks "Mr. Maker" </h4>
Mr. Maker he's got it made<br/>
A beautiful wife and a baby on the way<br/>
And his bills are already paid<br/>
No need to skimp, no need to save<br/>
But all around him, the world grows hard<br/>
He thinks to himself, he must have played a lucky card<br/>
If he was alone he'd give it all away<br/>
To people and things, that he wanted to save<br/>
<br/>
But oh no, it's alright<br/>
Mr. Maker, he'll be fine<br/>
It's alright, it's OK<br/>
Because of the love he gave away<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
Oh yeeeeeeeah<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't stop to think it's because of he<br/>
Always doing right, he stays healthy<br/>
The girls in the alley won't get a hold of him<br/>
He's got no time for that kind of sin<br/>
And he, he's not a member of the Catholic Church<br/>
The pastor of his town got sent down for dirt<br/>
He sees the boys from Sunday school<br/>
It's hard to believe what he read in the morning news<br/>
<br/>
But oh no, it's alright<br/>
Mr. Maker, he'll be fine<br/>
It's all right, it's OK<br/>
Because of the love he gave away<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
Oh yeeeeeeeah<br/>
<br/>
Heart beat, stay heavy<br/>
Love us all please, stay on your feet<br/>
For me<br/>
For me, stay on your feet for me<br/>
For me, stay on your feet for me<br/>
<br/>
But oh no, it's alright<br/>
Mr. Maker, he'll be fine<br/>
It's alright, it's OK<br/>
Because of the love he gave away<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
Oh yeeeeeeeah
