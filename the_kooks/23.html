<h4>The Kooks "Sofa Song </h4>

The city freeze before<br/>
I just realised I don't like you<br/>
Me and my girl<br/>
Are going out for some air<br/>
And I will do my best<br/>
Just to get under her dress<br/>
And catch you out if I can<br/>
On the other side of my sofa<br/>
<br/>
Won't you come on over<br/>
At the side of my sofa<br/>
Oh won't you come on over<br/>
<br/>
The city heated it up<br/>
It got blurry cause I'd had enough<br/>
And he tried to take your soul<br/>
But didn't realise you keep it in a different hole<br/>
<br/>
Won't you come on over<br/>
At the side of my sofa<br/>
Oh won't you come on over<br/>
<br/>
So here he comes, a man with<br/>
A loaded gun, I don't know if he<br/>
Wants my soul or my<br/>
Cash flow, I s'pose I don't know<br/>
<br/>
So here he comes, a man with a<br/>
A loaded gun I don't know if he<br/>
Wants my girl's heart or her pearls<br/>
I s'pose I don't know<br/>
I s'pose I don't know<br/>
I s'pose I don't know<br/>
I s'pose I don't know<br/>
I s'pose I don't know<br/>
