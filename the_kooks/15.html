<h4>The Kooks "No Longer" </h4>
I'm must say that I worry for<br/>
You can't live like this no more<br/>
I'm must say that I worry for you<br/>
<br/>
I'm must say that I worry for<br/>
Our love in this cold war<br/>
I'm must say that I worry for you<br/>
<br/>
Took me by suprise<br/>
that I just didn't see<br/>
She had a dark past,<br/>
of broken hearts<br/>
and she wanted love<br/>
But in the darkest times<br/>
she'll be honest with lies<br/>
Put her word in fancy dress<br/>
and we'll keep up this disguise<br/>
<br/>
No longer, its not getting stonger, no longer for me<br/>
<br/>
I'm must say that I worry for<br/>
You can't live like this no more<br/>
I'm must say that I worry for you<br/>
But you don't wanna think no more<br/>
Passed out on your bedroom floor<br/>
I'm must say that I worry for you<br/>
<br/>
Took me by suprise<br/>
that I once made a key<br/>
to open her dark heart<br/>
he broke apart what was once in love<br/>
But its clear now to see,<br/>
that man he was me,<br/>
so I go far far away from here<br/>
don't you follow me<br/>
<br/>
No longer were not getting stonger, no longer for me<br/>
<br/>
I'm must say that I worry for<br/>
You can't live like this no more<br/>
I'm must say that I worry for you<br/>
I'm must say that I worry for<br/>
Our love in this cold war<br/>
I'm must say that I worry for you<br/>
<br/>
I worry for you<br/>
I worry for you<br/>
I worry for you<br/>
I worry for you<br/>
<br/>
I'm just saying that I worry for<br/>
I'm just saying that I worry for<br/>
I'm just saying that I worry for<br/>
I'm just saying that I worry for<br/>
I'm just saying that I worry for<br/>
I'm just saying that I worry for<br/>
I'm just saying that I worry for<br/>
I'm just saying that I worry for<br/>
I'm just saying that I worry for<br/>
I'm just saying that I worry for<br/>
