<h4>The Kooks "She Moves In Her Own Way" </h4>

So at my show on Monday<br/>
I was hoping someday<br/>
You'd be on your way to better things<br/>
It's not about your make-up<br/>
Or how you try to shape up<br/>
To these tiresome paper dreams<br/>
Paper dreams, honey<br/>
<br/>
So now you pour your heart out<br/>
Your telling me you're far out<br/>
You're not about to lie down for your cause<br/>
But you dont pull my strings<br/>
'Cos I'm a better man<br/>
Moving on to better things<br/>
<br/>
Well uh oh, oh I love her because she moves in her own way<br/>
Well uh oh, oh she came to my show just to hear about my day<br/>
<br/>
And at the show on Tuesday<br/>
She was in her mindset<br/>
Tempered furs and spangled boots<br/>
Looks are deceiving<br/>
Make me believe it<br/>
And these tiresome paper dreams<br/>
Paper dreams, honey<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
So wont you go far<br/>
Tell me you're a keeper<br/>
Not about to lie down for your cause<br/>
And you don't pull my strings<br/>
'Cos I'm a better man<br/>
Moving on to better things<br/>
<br/>
Well oh oh, oh I love her because she moves in her own way<br/>
Well oh oh, oh she came to my show just to hear about my day<br/>
<br/>
Yes our winter storm will never make it<br/>
Through all the summers<br/>
Their keeping us instead of<br/>
Kicking us back<br/>
Down through the suburbs<br/>
Yes our winter storm will never make it<br/>
