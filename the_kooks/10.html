<h4>The Kooks "Down To The Market" </h4>
I'm gonna take you down to the market, lover<br/>
Cuz that's where the trouble starts<br/>
You gotta get it into your heart<br/>
There are people out there to make you feel bad<br/>
But don't you listen, baby don't you listen Because I know you feel that way<br/>
<br/>
But I'm getting so tired of people always crossing my wires<br/>
Life's just far too short for miscommunication<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna take her down to the market today<br/>
Cuz thatâ€™s where the trouble starts<br/>
You don't want nobody else<br/>
There are people out there to make you feel good<br/>
But don't you listen, baby, don't you listen Because you know they want it all<br/>
<br/>
But I'm getting so tired of people always crossing my wires<br/>
Life's just far too short for miscommunication.<br/>
<br/>
Oh I'm getting so tired of people always crossing my wires<br/>
Life's just far too short for miscommunication.<br/>
<br/>
Communication, communication<br/>
