<h4>The Kooks "One Last Time" </h4>
Can I hold you one last time<br/>
To fight the feeling that is growing in my mind<br/>
I know I did us both all so wrong<br/>
I know I'm not always all that strong<br/>
<br/>
A-b-c-d-e-f and -g<br/>
Oh that reminds me of when we were free<br/>
Before life began to tear us apart<br/>
Remember those classes when we thought we were so smart<br/>
<br/>
Ooooooooh<br/>
Ooooooooh<br/>
<br/>
We were lovers in every way<br/>
Left school together, went back to my place<br/>
Now I can hardly remember her face<br/>
Before I met her I was ..sad<br/>
<br/>
Ooooooooh<br/>
Ooooooooh<br/>
<br/>
And can I hold you one last time<br/>
To fight this feeling that is growing in my mind<br/>
