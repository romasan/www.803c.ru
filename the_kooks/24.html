Did you see the way she looks at me<br/>
She's got an eye for an awkward guy like me<br/>
<br/>
I tried to love her back<br/>
And then I shrunk back into my wrap<br/>
And in the barrel of my gun<br/>
I hope i'm not the only one<br/>

Did you see the way she looks at me<br/>
A honeybee got two lives and she's got me<br/>
<br/>
I tried to love her back (she's just a girl)<br/>
And then I shrunk back into my wrap (she's just a girl)<br/>
And in the barrel of my gun<br/>
I hope i'm not the only one<br/>
And in the barrel of my gun<br/>
I hope i'm not the only one<br/>
<br/>
Do do, do do do<br/>

I tried to love her back (she's just a girl)<br/>
And then I shrunk back into my wrap (she's just a girl)<br/>
And in the barrel of my gun<br/>
I hope i'm not the only one<br/>
And in the barrel of my gun<br/>
I hope i'm not the only one<br/>
