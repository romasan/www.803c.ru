Do you want to go to the seaside?<br/>
I'm not trying to say that everybody wants to go<br/>
I fell in love at the seaside<br/>
I handled my charm with time and slight of hand<br/>

Do you want to go to the seaside?<br/>
I'm not trying to say that everybody wants to go<br/>
I fell in love at the seaside<br/>
She handled her charm with time and slight of hand, and oh<br/>
<br/>
But I'm just trying to love you<br/>
In any kind of way<br/>
But I find it hard to love you girl<br/>
When you're far away<br/>
Away<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to go to the seaside?<br/>
I'm not trying to say that everybody wants to go<br/>
But I fell in love on the seaside<br/>
On the seaside<br/>
