<h4>The Kooks "Sway"</h4>

Say whatever you have to say<br/>
I won't judge you<br/> 
Be whoever you have to be<br/>
To get it out and not become<br/>
A reactionary to hurt the ones you love<br/>
I know you never meant to but you did<br/>
But you did<br/>
<br/>
Be whoever you have to be<br/>
I'll stand by you<br/>
And sing whenever you have to sing<br/>
To get it out and not become<br/>
A recluse about your house, come out<br/>
I know you never meant to but you did<br/>
Oh but you did<br/>
<br/>
Still I need your sway<br/>
Cos you always pay for it<br/>
And I and I need your soul<br/>
Cos you're always soulful<br/>
And I and I need your heart<br/>
Cos you're always in the right places<br/>
<br/>
Do whatever you have to do<br/>
you know I love you<br/>
And be however you have to be<br/>
To get it out, and get it out<br/>
Take it<br/>
Take it out on me<br/>
Take it out on me<br/>
Ill give it you all<br/>
Ill give it you all<br/>
Ill give it you all<br/>
Ill give it you all<br/>
Ill give it you aaallllll<br/>
<br/>
Still I need your sway<br/>
Cos you always pay for it<br/>
And I and I need your soul<br/>
Cos you're always soulful<br/>
And I and I need your heart<br/>
