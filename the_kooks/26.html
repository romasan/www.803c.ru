<h4>The Kooks "You Don't Love Me" </h4>

But you don't love me the way that, I love you<br/>
'Cos if you did girl you would not, do those things you do<br/>
You killed my heart just to see if, I will rise<br/>
Above your anger and above your lies<br/>
<br/>
And all I see of you, is when you're not so busy<br/>
Oh your not so busy<br/>
<br/>
But you don't love me the way that, I love you<br/>
'Cos if you did boy you would not, do the things you do<br/>
You killed my heart just to see if, I will rise<br/>
Above your anger and above your lies<br/>
<br/>
But oh my darling look at you<br/>
The words that only you could use<br/>
But you no you'll always be my girl, girl<br/>
I'll take you out just for a while<br/>
Show you all the city sites<br/>
But you no you'll always be my girl, girl<br/>
<br/>
But you don't love me the way that, I love you<br/>
'Cos if you did girl you would not, do those things you do<br/>
You turned my life around and for that, I am glad<br/>
However much I love you this love, is getting bad<br/>
<br/>
And all I see of you, is when you're not so busy<br/>
Oh your not so busy<br/>
<br/>
But you don't love me you don't care, woman<br/>
But you don't love me you don't care, woman<br/>
But you don't love me you don't care, woman<br/>
But you don't love me you don't care, woman<br/>
Oh woman<br/>
