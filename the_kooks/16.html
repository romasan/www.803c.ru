<h4>The Kooks "Fa La La La La" </h4>

Mmmmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
You're out there having fun<br/>
And I need you<br/>
I'm alone with this song<br/>
About being empty<br/>
And the fear of missing out<br/>
It's hard to be alone<br/>
Nineteen miles I've walked<br/>
Up and down the hall<br/>
<br/>
Long hall<br/>
<br/>
Oh god I miss my girl<br/>
It's only been a night<br/>
I miss the last time<br/>
That we had a fight<br/>
Isn't it sad?<br/>
Won't you say it's bad?<br/>
I don't care and if I have to<br/>
I'll read your books<br/>
Cause they'll remind me of you<br/>
<br/>
And I'll learn your notes<br/>
So that I have a clue<br/>
And I'll watch your films<br/>
So I'll know them through and through<br/>
And I'll do the things that remind me of you<br/>
And I'll wash my hair in your shampoo<br/>
And I'll buy your perfume<br/>
And spray it round my room<br/>
And I'll smoke your cigarettes<br/>
So that I'm dying too<br/>
And I'll call you up<br/>
<br/>
Fa la la la<br/>
Fa la la la<br/>
Fa la la la<br/>
Oh<br/>
<br/>
Am I sane?<br/>
Am I sane?<br/>
Am I sane?<br/>
<br/>
Mmmmmmm.<br/>
